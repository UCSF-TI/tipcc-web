# TIPCC - a High-Performance Compute Environment at UCSF

At the UCSF Helen Diller Family Comprehensive Cancer Center we have a large Linux compute cluster that is available to anyone affiliated with the Cancer Center - feel free to [contact us] if you would like to [join] or have questions.

As of January 2019, the cluster has 32 nodes and ~1,300 cores, which predominantly are AMD processors. Each node has up to 512 GiB of RAM and up to 10 TiB of fast local disk space. In addition to ~175 TiB global disk space shared among all users, several research groups have their own storage mounted on the cluster.  For more details, see the [cluster specifications].
