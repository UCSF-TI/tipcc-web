# Missing Software?

Don't find the software you need for your analysis?
Did you make sure it is not in one of the [software repositories]({{ '/software/software-repositories.html' | relative_url }})?
If so, you have a few options:

1. Install it yourself to your own account
   - Download a pre-built binary
   - Build software from source (traditional, e.g. `./configure --prefix ~/software`, `make`, and `make install`)
<!-- - Build software from source (using Spack, e.g. `spack list` and `spack install pango`) -->
   <br><br>

2. Reach out to the [TIPCC user community]({{ '/support/index.html' | relative_url }})
   - It could be that someone else has already installed it,
     is interested in also installing it, or is willing to help
   <br><br>

3. Core software
   - If a core software is missing, it may be that the [the systems administrator]({{ '/about/contact.html' | relative_url }}) is willing to add it to the core installation
