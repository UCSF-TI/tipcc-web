# User Support

For questions and feature requests, please use either of:

1. the [TIPCC issue tracker](https://github.com/UCSF-TI/TIPCC/issues) - this is a _private_ repository which gives an "404 This is not the web page you are looking for" error if you are not logged in to GitHub or do not have been given access (if you don't have access, please [send us](../about/contact.html) your [GitHub username](https://github.com/join))
2. the [TIPCC mailing list](mailto:TIPCC@listsrv.ucsf.edu)

These forums are monitored by the system administrator among others.

There are several advantages of using these communal resources.  For instance, if multiple users experience the same issues, it helps avoiding duplicating similar questions and requests.  When new software installations are requested, it allows everyone to see what is in the pipeline and to share their interests in the same software ("we need it too").  It also allows anyone to reply, which increases your chances for quick resolutions.  The advantage of using the issue tracker rather than the mailing list is that we can easily refer back to previously resolved issues and answers.

If you have requests that you rather prefer to address directly to the systems administrator, please don't hesitate to contact the [CBI Director](../about/contact.html).
